Keylogger for Windows using Windows system hooks. (FOR FUN! DO NOT USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES!)

This repository consists of two Visual Studio (2019) solutions: the client and the server.

To try it, run the server code first. Then, put your ip address in the client code and run the client. The output should be saved in a text file local to the server code.
